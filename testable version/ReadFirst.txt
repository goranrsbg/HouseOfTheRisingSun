Extract all *.rar files inside /res/maps into current directory so that BB-BB-locator.jar can load all maps.
Directory structure should look like this:

/root/
     /db - will be created after fist application run (derby database with all tables and default data)
     /lib
     /res/
         /fonts
         /img
         /maps
         /sql

Jar will be updated as application grows.
